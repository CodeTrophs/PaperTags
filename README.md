## About the Idea ( PaperTags )

```

CodeTrophs is expanding into the field of AI. We are aiming at making a platform that allows the student looking to intern under a professor to select a professor by assisting them with the professor's field of study, research papers and field of expertise, assigning each of his papers with specific tags given by the model and an abstract about each paper. Further we are opening a whole new avenue for the professors who are bombarded with emails from students willing to intern under him/her. This will be done by a list based on the professor's requirements from the student on the basis of his/her profile containing the skills, GPA, field of interest in a well categorised format created by them. In-short we are bridging the gap between a professor and a student.

## Stage 1

The first task includes each of you selecting a college from the list provided to you and scrapping the details of all the professors and categorising them on the basis of 

- Name
- Department 
- Email ID (most important)
